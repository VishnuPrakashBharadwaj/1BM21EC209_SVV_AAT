## Problem statements
1. Identify a transactor that helps in verifying a DUT that sorts 8 bit values on A,B,C,D,E,F,G and H in ascending order. Implement the test environment that handles all the possible cases.
2. If the logic design has streaming 1 bit input through X , then the logic is to detect past two values along with the present value and give Z as 1 if there are exactly 2 ones otherwise 0. <br>
   If the input stream is X : 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 <br>
   Then, output stream is Z : 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 <br>
   <br>
   - Design a transactor for driving this random input.
   - Apply constraints to the randomized data to verify the required scenarios.
   - How do we verify this property through assertions?
3. There is a 3-bit up-down counter that is controlled with an enable(en) and mode(M). The verilog behavior described for the design is as given below:
   ```verilog
   module cnt_up_dwn(input clk, rst, en, M, output [2:0] count);
      reg[2:0] R;
      assign count = M ? R + en : R - en;
      always@(posedge clk or posedge rst)
         R <= rst ? 3â€™d0 : count;
   endmodule
   ```
